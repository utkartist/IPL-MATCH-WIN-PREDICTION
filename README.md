## Overview

Cricket, especially the T20 format like IPL, is a game of uncertainties. Predicting the outcome of a match involves analyzing various factors such as player performance, pitch conditions, and in-game dynamics. This project leverages historical IPL match data to train machine learning models that can predict the probable winner of a match based on the current state of the game.

## Datasets

The project utilizes two primary datasets:

1. **Matches Dataset (`matches.csv`)**: Contains detailed information about IPL matches, including teams, scores, outcomes, player of the match, venue, and more.

2. **Deliveries Dataset (`deliveries.csv`)**: Contains ball-by-ball data for each match, providing granular details like batsman, bowler, runs scored, extras, dismissals, etc.

*Both datasets should be placed in the same directory as the project notebook.*

## Features

Key features engineered and utilized in the modeling process include:

- **Current Score**: Total runs scored by the batting team at the current point in the match.
- **Overs Completed**: Number of overs bowled.
- **Wickets Fallen**: Number of wickets lost by the batting team.
- **Runs Remaining**: Runs needed by the batting team to win.
- **Balls Remaining**: Balls left in the innings.
- **Current Run Rate (CRR)**: Runs scored per over till the current point.
- **Required Run Rate (RRR)**: Runs required per over to win.
- **Team Encodings**: Representing teams in a numerical format suitable for modeling.

## Machine Learning Models

Two machine learning algorithms were employed:

1. **Logistic Regression**:
   - A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.
   - Suitable for binary classification tasks like predicting win or loss.

2. **Random Forest Classifier**:
   - An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification tasks.
   - Handles overfitting better and captures complex patterns in the data.

Both models were trained and evaluated to compare performance, with hyperparameter tuning applied to optimize their predictive capabilities.

## Results

- **Accuracy**:
- Both models achieved commendable accuracy, with the Random Forest Classifier slightly outperforming Logistic Regression.

- **Confusion Matrix**:
- Showed the number of correct and incorrect predictions, indicating areas where the model performs well and where it struggles.

- **ROC Curve and AUC**:
- The Random Forest Classifier exhibited a higher Area Under the Curve (AUC), suggesting better discrimination between the classes.

*Detailed results, including graphs and evaluation metrics, are available in the project notebook.*
